# Observer

The observer pattern is a software design pattern in which an object, called the subject, maintains a list of its 
dependents, called observers, and notifies them automatically of any state changes, usually by calling one of their 
methods. 

* Define a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object changes state, all its dependents are notified 
and updated automatically.

* Encapsulate the core (or common or engine) components in a Subject abstraction, and the variable (or optional or user 
interface) components in an Observer hierarchy.
