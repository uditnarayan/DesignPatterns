# Strategy Pattern

The strategy pattern (also known as the policy pattern) is a behavioral software design pattern that enables selecting 
an algorithm at runtime. Family of algorithms which solves a common problem are defined as individual strategy. The 
strategies are interchangeable as they implement from a common interface. This lets the algorithm vary independently 
from clients that use it.

**Note:** Check the corresponding directory in tests for test cases.
